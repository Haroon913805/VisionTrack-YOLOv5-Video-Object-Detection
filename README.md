# VisionTrack-YOLOv5-Video-Object-Detection
VisionTrack is a real-time object detection system that leverages the YOLOv5 model to identify and label objects within video streams. Built using PyTorch and OpenCV, this project demonstrates how to apply deep learning techniques for object detection tasks in video data.
