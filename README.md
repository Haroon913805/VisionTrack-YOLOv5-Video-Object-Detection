# VisionTrack-YOLOv5-Video-Object-Detection
VisionTrack is a real-time object detection system that leverages the YOLOv5 model to identify and label objects within video streams. Built using PyTorch and OpenCV, this project demonstrates how to apply deep learning techniques for object detection tasks in video data.

üîç Features

YOLOv5 Integration: Utilizes the pre-trained YOLOv5s model from Ultralytics for efficient and accurate object detection.


Video Processing: Processes video files frame by frame, applying object detection to each frame.


Real-Time Display: Displays the processed video with bounding boxes and labels indicating detected objects.


Customizable Window Size: Allows users to set a specific window size for the video display to suit different screen resolutions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used


Python: Programming language used for scripting and implementation.


PyTorch: Deep learning framework used to load and run the YOLOv5 model.


OpenCV: Library used for video processing and display.
